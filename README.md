# Arena (formerly know as SPMPlayground)

Arena is a macOS command line tool to create an Xcode project with a Swift Playground that's readily set up to use a Swift Package Manager library. You can reference both Github and local repositories. The latter is especially useful to spin up a Playground while working on a library.

Arena â€“ Spanish for "sand" â€“ is where you battle-test your SPM packages and sand is, well, abundant in playgrounds, isn't it? ðŸ™‚

```
 ~  arena --help
OVERVIEW: Creates an Xcode project with a Playground and one or more SPM libraries imported and ready for use.

USAGE: arena [options]

OPTIONS:
  --deps, -d         Dependency url(s) and (optionally) version specification [default: []]
  --force, -f        Overwrite existing file/directory [default: false]
  --help, -h         Display available options [default: false]
  --libs, -l         Names of libraries to import (inferred if not provided) [default: []]
  --name, -n         Name of directory and Xcode project [default: SPM-Playground]
  --outputdir, -o    Directory where project folder should be saved [default: /Users/sas/Projects/Arena]
  --platform, -p     Platform for Playground (one of 'macos', 'ios', 'tvos') [default: macos]
  --version, -v      Display tool version [default: false]
```

## Examples

### Import Github repository

```
 ~  arena -d https://github.com/finestructure/Gala
ðŸ”§  resolving package dependencies
ðŸ“”  libraries found: Gala
âœ…  created project in folder 'arena'
```

### Import local repository

```
arena -d ~/Projects/Parser
ðŸ”§  resolving package dependencies
ðŸ“”  libraries found: Parser
âœ…  created project in folder 'arena'
```

### Import both

```
arena -d ~/Projects/Parser https://github.com/finestructure/Gala
ðŸ”§  resolving package dependencies
ðŸ“”  libraries found: Parser, Gala
âœ…  created project in folder 'arena'
```

## Specifying versions

In case you want to fetch a particular revision, range of revisions, or branch, you can use a syntax similar to the one used in a `Package.swift` file. Here's what's supported and the corresponding package dependecy that it will create in the generated project:

- `-d https://github.com/finestructure/Gala@0.1.0`
  
  â†’ `.package(url: "https://github.com/finestructure/Gala", .exact("0.1.0"))`

- `-d https://github.com/finestructure/Gala@from:0.1.0`
  
  â†’ `.package(url: "https://github.com/finestructure/Gala", from: "0.1.0")`

- `-d "https://github.com/finestructure/Gala@0.1.0..<4.0.0"`

  â†’ `.package(url: "https://github.com/finestructure/Gala", "0.1.0"..<"4.0.0")`

- `-d https://github.com/finestructure/Gala@0.1.0...4.0.0` 

  â†’ `.package(url: "https://github.com/finestructure/Gala", "0.1.0"..<"4.0.1")`

- `-d https://github.com/finestructure/Gala@branch:master` 

  â†’ `.package(url: "https://github.com/finestructure/Gala", .branch("master"))`

- `-d https://github.com/finestructure/Gala@revision:7235531e92e71176dc31e77d6ff2b128a2602110` 

  â†’ `.package(url: "https://github.com/finestructure/Gala", .revision("7235531e92e71176dc31e77d6ff2b128a2602110"))`

Make sure to properly quote the URL if you are using the `..<` range operator. Otherwise your shell will interpret the `<` character as input redirection.

## How to build and install

You can build and install `arena` via the included `Makefile` by running:

```
make install
```

This will copy the binary `arena` to `/usr/local/bin`.

## Compatibility

`arena` was built and tested on macOS 10.15 Catalina using Swift 5.1.3. It should work on other versions of macOS and Swift as well.
